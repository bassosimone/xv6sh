# Unix-v6-like shell written in Rust

This repository contains a Unix-v6-like shell implemented in Rust.

I wrote this code to exercise with Rust. I do not plan on maintaining
this code base or on adding additional features. It's likely the
case that this code behaves differently from the original v6 shell.

## Building and running

You need `rustc` and `cargo` (possibly via `rustup`).

To build:

```
cargo build
```

To run:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Design

The design is quite traditional for a compiler-like tool:

1. there is a lexer (see [src/lexer.rs](src/lexer.rs)) that
implements the `scan` stage;

2. the lexer feeds a parser (see [src/parser.rs](src/parser.rs)),
which produces a _parse tree_ in the `parse` stage;

3. we validate the parse tree and transform it for easier execution
(see [src/translator.rs](src/translator.rs)) in the `plan` stage;

4. we interpret the transformed output (see [src/interp.rs](src/interp.rs))
to execute shell commands in the `run` stage.

When we encounter commands between `(` and `)` we execute them in
a subshell. We pass code to the subshell by serializing the specific
portion of the parse tree using [src/serializer.rs](src/serializer.rs).

## Command Line Flags

The `-x` command line argument turns verbose mode on.

The `--stage STAGE` flag stops processing at the given `STAGE`
and shows internal data structures.

The `-c COMMANDS` command allows a shell (or a sub-shell) to
execute a sequence of commands.

source code that I started from. The implementation diverged
quickly but there are still original-code ideas. For this reason,
